About me: 

## Projects:

### Endgame: chess database

I always loved chess and computers, Endgame is a convergence of both my passions. An iOS application, that lets users see all the world championship games. I developed this application on my free time and it’s the project that I’m the most proud of.  Endgame: chess database can be found in the App Store.

### LSM

Developed the application for my school, ITESM, and for my final project of an iOS course. The application helps users learn the Mexican sign language using interactive games, LSM can be found in the App Store.
