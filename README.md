## Projects:

### Endgame: chess database

I always loved chess and computers, Endgame is a convergence of both my passions. An iOS application, that lets users see all the world championship games. I developed this application on my free time and it’s the project that I’m the most proud of. Endgame: chess database can be found in the App Store.
