## About me:

My name is Jorge and I live in Monterrey, Mexico. Since I was a kid I liked computers, I still remember when my parents bought my first computer, an Apple MacBook. It felt like magic, although when I found out that the Mac Operative System did not run games like the Windows computers did the magic wore off. That’s when I started to play the only game that ran in my Mac, chess. To me it seems that I always knew how to play chess, as if I was born knowing the game, of course that is not the case. I started getting into chess in high school and college where I started representing my schools by competing in some tournaments in Mexico. I finish my Software Enginieer degree in ITESM (College in Monterrey, Mexico) and been working as an ios developer since.

## Personal Projects:

###   Endgame: chess database

I always loved chess and computers, Endgame is a convergence of both my passions. An iOS application, that lets users see all the world championship games. I developed this application on my free time and it’s the project that I’m the most proud of. Endgame: chess database can be found in the App Store.
